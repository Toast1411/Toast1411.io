 <b><subheading> What is Skylanders?</subheading></b>
 <p>Skylanders is a video game franchise that brought the idea of NFC technology to allow figures to become playable characters in their games. This concept spanned across 6 games and even inspired games like disney infinity,lego dimensions, and even amiibo. This game series started release at october 13, 2011, ending its production of games at late 2016. However its legacy lives on through its idea and the fans that still make a market for keeping the game alive to them. </p>
 <b><subheading>What characters are there in this game</subheading></b>
 <p> Some of the common cast you will find is characters such as trigger happy, gill grunt, and even the more well known spyro (who comes from his own series of games)</p>
